# React, TypeScript, and Material-UI boilerplate

## Introduction

Welcome to the first app template built by [Welcome, Developer](https://www.welcomedeveloper.com)! This is a boilerplate app built using React, TypeScript, Material-UI, and uses the concept of CSS-in-JS. It has the purpose of supporting our post exercises, but also to provide our followers with a good start point when building React applications.

Hope you enjoy it, developers!

## Demo

Keen to see the app in action? Check it out the [live demo](https://weldev-react-mui-ts.vercel.app/)!

## Behind-the-scenes

Interested in learning how the app was built from scratch step-by-step on version 1.00? Check [it out](https://www.welcomedeveloper.com/react-typescript-material-design), developers!

The versions that followed the first one, 1.10 and 2.00, consist of adding coding formatting libraries (ESLint and Prettier), and updating the Material-UI library to its latest version (v5.0.1). I highly recommend you to explore the tutorial above to learn how the app was built.

## Features

The following frameworks/libraries have been implemented:

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
3. [MUI](https://mui.com/)
4. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
5. [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
6. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Install

To get up and running with the template, you just have to run the _git_ commands below:

```
git clone https://github.com/danilocastronz/weldev-project-react-mui-ts-bp
cd weldev-project-react-mui-ts-bp
yarn install
```
